                 food and we know you guys do too. Eating street food is a not

                    street foods from around the world that you must try – from

                <h2> 1. Chimney Cake in the Czech Republic </h2>
                <p> Trdelník aka “chimney cake” is both a novelty photo opp and
                  a sweet treat all rolled into one! These spiral-shaped donuts
                  are made by wrapping the batter around a large spit, which is
                   then cooked over a grill, rolled in sugar and served with
                   lashings of Nutella. What’s not to love!? Guaranteed to warm
                   your cockles on a cold Czech morn. </p>

                   <h2> 2. Masala Dosa in India </h2>
                   <p> The humble masala dosa is indigenous to the Southern
                     states of India and usually comes served with sambar and
                     chutney. It’s cheap, quick and high in carbohydrates.
                     Perfect for hungry adventurers on the go.</p>

                    <h2> 3. Poutine in Canada </h2>
                    <p> And just like that, your hangover is cured! Poutine is
                      a lavishly indulgent treat, originating in Quebec and
                      made up of fries, cheese curds and gravy. It might not be
                      the first thing that comes to mind when you think of
                      street foods from around the world, but it’s not to be
                      missed. The word “poutine” is Québécois slang for a “mess”
                      but there’s no need to worry about how it looks when
                      it tastes this good!</p>

                     <h2> 4. Currywurst in Germany</h2>
                     <p> Perhaps not the most sophisticated dish by sight but
                       certainly not the wurst (lolololol). When you first touch
                       down in Germany you need to make a beeline for this
                       traditional dish, which is essentially a ketchup/curry
                       sauce hybrid with chopped pork sausage and fries.
                       Supremely tasty and ever so cheap!</p>

                        <div>
                      <h2> 5. Pastel de Nata in Portugal</h2>
                      <p> There’s nothing raw or clean about these bad boys,
                        but dammit they’re worth falling off the wagon for.
                        This is Portugal’s answer to the custard tart and the
                        main ingredients are sugar, egg yolks and butter.
                        But because they’re not huge, it’s probably fine for
                        you to have 3 in one sitting. At least that’s what we
                        tell ourselves.</p>

                       <div>
                       <h2> 6. Jerk Chicken in Jamaica</h2>
                       <p> A smoky staple of the Jamaican street food scene,
                         this iconic dish is traditionally served from jerk
                         ‘huts’ with a side of fiery rice and peas. The name
                         ‘jerk’ comes from the jerking or poking of the meat
                         with a sharp object to get the most out of the flavour.
                         You’ll smell the spicy-sweet marinade over the native
                         pimento wood from miles around when these bad boys are
                          cooking!</p>

                        <h2> 7. Halo Halo in the Philippines</h2>
                        <p> Well, HELLO there halo halo. Definitely one of the
                          most instagram-able street foods from around the world.
                          Translated into English as “mix mix”, the ingredients
                          are up for debate but usually consist of shaved ice,
                          fresh fruit, ice cream, a jelly-like object, a
                          crunchy substance similar to Rice Krispies, and
                          evaporated milk. A tasty treat for kids both big and small!
                        </p>

                         <div>
                         <h2> 8. Pad Thai in Thailand</h2>
                         <p> Ubiquitous across the whole of Thailand as a quick
                            and filling meal, this is one of the originals when
                            it comes to street food from around the world.
                            What’s most fascinating about Pad Thai, however,
                            is that it probably isn’t even traditionally Thai.
                            Noodles, stir-fry, and, especially, ‘noodle
                            stir-fries’ are quintessentially Chinese…oo-err.
                            Whatever the origins, this is one street food dish
                            you must not miss when you visit Thailand.
                         </p>

                          <h2> 9. Churros in Spain</h2>
                          <p> One of the naughtiest but also one of the tastiest
                            street foods from around the world, churros are a
                            MUST for hungry backpackers travelling through Spain.
                            As if these freshly fried donut sticks weren’t
                            delicious enough, they come served with the most
                            divine melted chocolate, either drizzled on top or
                            in a pot for dunking.
                          </p>

                           <h2> 10. Baklava in Turkey</h2>
                           <p> Made from many layers of pastry, oozing with
                             syrup and pistachios and often crafted from a
                             carefully guarded family recipe, Baklava is one
                             epic sugar rush you MUST experience when you visit
                             Turkey. A bag of these heavenly parcels is the
                             perfect accompaniment for watching one of
                             Istanbul’s famous sunsets with friends.
